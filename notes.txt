Network Programming = Socket Programming

* Network Programming :

    * Also known as Socker programming because the network programming 
    itself is based on sockets.

    * Definition :
        building a program that receives and transmits data between two or more
        computers by means of network.

* A simple under of Sockets :

    * Provided by the operating system within devices.
    * Sockets provides a high level of abstraction for programmers so that we dont have to worry about underlaying physical and software details of networking.

* The 5 "Must-know" fundamental details of socket programming :

1. Socket :

    * Creating a socket (A socket descriptor)
        * TCP Socket can be compared to a phone -> We need a device to call someone or accept their phone call, right ?
        * To perform network I/O, the first thing a process must do is, call the socket function to create a specific type of socket by specifying the type of communication protocol desired, protocol family, etc.

        ```
        #include <sys/socket.h>
        
        int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
        ```
        -> Creating a socket descriptor.
