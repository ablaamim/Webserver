    <h1>CGI</h1>
    <p>CGI is a standard for interfacing external applications with information servers, such as HTTP or web servers. A plain HTML document that the Web daemon retrieves is static, which means it exists in a constant state; a CGI program, on the other hand, is executed in real-time, so that it can output dynamic information.</p>
